| **Compassion Fade** | People have more compassion for small groups of victims than larger groups, because the smaller the group the easier it is to identify individual victims. |
| **System Justification Theory** | Inefficient systems will be defended and maintained if they serve the needs of people who benefit from them – individual incentives can sustain systemic stupidity. |
| **Three Men Make a Tiger** | People will believe anything if enough people tell them it’s true. It comes from a Chinese proverb that if one person tells you there’s a tiger roaming around your neighborhood, you can assume they’re lying. If two people tell you, you begin to wonder. If three say it’s true, you’re convinced there’s a tiger in your neighborhood and you panic. |
| **Burdian’s Ass** | A thirsty donkey is placed exactly midway between two pails of water. It dies because it can’t make a rational decision about which one to choose. A form of decision paralysis. |

| **Impostor Syndrome** | Fear of being exposed as less talented than people think you are, often because talent is owed to cumulative advantage rather than actual effort or skill. |
| **Ringelmann Effect** | Members of a group become lazier as the size of their group increases. Based on the assumption that “someone else is probably taking care of that.” |

| **Planck’s Principle** | “A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.” |
| **Courtesy Bias** | Giving opinions that are likely to offend people the least, rather than what you actually believe. |
| **The 90-9-1 Rule** | In social media networks, 90% of users just read content, 9% of users contribute a little content, and 1% of users contribute almost all the content. Gives a false impression of what ideas are popular or “average.” |

| **Plain Folks Fallacy** | People of authority acquiring trust by presenting themselves as Average Joe’s, when in fact their authority proves they are different from everyone else. |
| **Hanlon’s Razor** | “Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.” |
| **Empathy Gap** | Underestimating how you’ll behave when you’re “hot” (angry/aroused/rushed), caused by the inability to accurately foresee how your body’s physical response to situations (dopamine, adrenaline, etc.) will influence decision-making. |
| **Abilene Paradox** | A group decides to do something that no one in the group wants to do because everyone mistakenly assumes they’re the only ones who object to the idea and they don’t want to rock the boat by speaking up. |

| **Moral Luck** | Praising someone for a good deed they didn’t have full control over. “Avoid calling heroes those who had no other choice.” – Taleb. |

| **Tribal Affiliation** | Beliefs can be swayed by identity and a desire to fit in over rational analysis. There is little correlation between climate change denial and scientific literacy. But there is a strong correlation between climate change denial and political affiliation. |
