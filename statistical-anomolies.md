Statistical Anomolies
=====================

Many of these come from: [100 Little Ideas](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/100-little-ideas/)

| Phrase | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **Pareto Principle** | The majority of outcomes are driven by a minority of events. |
| **Sturgeon’s Law** | “90% of everything is crap.” The obvious inverse of the Pareto Principle, but hard to accept in practice. |
| **Anscombe’s Quartet** | Four sets of numbers that look identical on paper (mean average, variance, correlation, etc.) but look completely different when graphed. Describes a situation where exact calculations don’t offer a good representation of how the world works. [Companion Image](#ascombes-quartet) |
| **Normalcy Bias** | Underestimating the odds of disaster because it’s comforting to assume things    will keep functioning the way they’ve always functioned. |
| **Neglect of Probability** | Arguing that Nate Silver was wrong when he said Hillary Clinton has a 70% chance of winning, and using Donald Trump’s victory as your proof. Good predictions are based on probabilities, but the assessment of predictions are always binary, right or wrong. |
| **Non-Ergodic** | When group probabilities don’t apply to singular events. If 100 people play Russian Roulette once, the odds of dying might be, say, 10%. But if one person plays Russian Roulette 100 times, the odds are dying are practically 100%. |
| **Reflexivity** | When cause and effect are the same. People think Tesla will sell a lot of cars, so Tesla stock goes up, which lets Tesla raise a bunch of new capital, which helps Tesla sell a lot of cars. |
| **Second Half of the Chessboard** | Put one grain of rice on the first chessboard square, two on the next, four on the next, then eight, then sixteen, etc, doubling the amount of rice on each square. When you’ve covered half the chessboard’s squares you’re dealing with an amount of rice that can fit in your lap; in the second half you quickly get to a pile that will consume an entire city. That’s how compounding works: slowly, then ferociously. |
| **Foundational Species** | A single thing that plays an outsized role in supporting an ecosystem, whose loss would pull down many others with it. In nature: kelp, algae, and coral. In business: The Federal Reserve and Amazon. |
| **Denomination Effect** | One hundred $1 bills feels like less money than one $100 bill. Also explains stock splits – buying 10 shares for $10 each feels cheaper than one share for $100. |
