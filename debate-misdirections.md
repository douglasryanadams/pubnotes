Debate Misdirections
====================

Many of these come from: [100 Little Ideas](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/100-little-ideas/)

| Phrase | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **Appeal to Consequences** | Arguing that a hypothesis must be true (or false) because the outcome is something you like (or dislike). The classic example is arguing that climate change isn’t real because combating climate change will hurt the economy. |
| **Weasel Words** | Phrases that appear to have meaning but convey nothing tangible. “Growth was solid last quarter,” or “Many people believe.” |
| **Aumann’s Agreement Theorem** | If you understand your opponent’s beliefs you cannot agree to disagree. If you agree to disagree it’s because one side doesn’t understand the other side’s view. |
