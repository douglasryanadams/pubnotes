Cognitive Distortions
=====================

Many of these come from: [100 Little Ideas](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/100-little-ideas/)

| Phrase | Desription |
| ------ | ---------- |
| **Curse of Knowledge** | The inability to communicate your ideas because you wrongly assume others have the necessary background to understand what you’re talking about. |
| **Base Rates** | The success rate of everyone who’s done what you’re about to try. |
| **Base-Rate Neglect** | Assuming the success rate of everyone who’s done what you’re about to try doesn’t apply to you, caused by overestimating the extent to which you do things differently than everyone else. |
| **Compassion Fade** |  People have more compassion for small groups of victims than larger groups, because the smaller the group the easier it is to identify individual victims. |
| **False-Consensus Effect** | Overestimating how widely held your own beliefs are, caused by the difficulty of imagining the experiences of other people. |
| **Group Attribution Error** | Incorrectly assuming that the views of a group member reflect those of the whole group. |
| **Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon** | Noticing an idea everywhere you look as soon as it’s brought to your attention in a way that makes you overestimate its prevalence. |
| **Ludic Fallacy** | Falsely associated simulations with real life. Nassim Taleb: “Organized competitive fighting trains the athlete to focus on the game and, in order not to dissipate his concentration, to ignore the possibility of what is not specifically allowed by the rules, such as kicks to the groin, a surprise knife, et cetera. So those who win the gold medal might be precisely those who will be most vulnerable in real life.” |
| **Actor-Observer Asymmetry** | We judge others based solely on their actions, but when judging ourselves we have an internal dialogue that justifies our mistakes and bad decisions. |
| **Apophenia** | A tendency to perceive correlations between unrelated things, because your mind can only deal with tiny sample sizes and assuming things are correlated creates easy/comforting explanations of how the world works. |
| **Self-Handicapping** | Avoiding effort because you don’t want to deal with the emotional pain of that effort failing. |
| **False Uniqueness Effect** | Assuming your skills are unique when they’re not. Comes from conflating “I’m good at this” with “Others are bad at this.” |
| **Hard-Easy Effect** | Hard tasks promote overconfidence because the rewards are high and fun to dream about; easy tasks promote underconfidence because they’re boring and easy to put off. |
| **Pollyanna Principle** | It’s easier to remember happy memories than bad ones.
| **Declinism** | Perpetually viewing society as in decline, because you’re afflicted by the Pollyanna Principle and you forget how much things sucked in the past. |
| **Friendship Paradox** | On average, people have fewer friends than their friends have. Occurs because people with an abnormally high number of friends are more likely to be one of your friends. It’s a fundamental part of social network dynamics and makes most people feel less popular than they are. |
| **Hedonic Treadmill** | Expectations rise with results, so nothing feels as good as you’d imagine for as long as you’d expect. |
| **Positive Illusions** | Excessively rosy views about the decisions you’ve made to maintain self-esteem in a world where everyone makes bad decisions all the time. |
| **Ironic Process Theory** | Going out of your way to suppress thoughts makes those thoughts more prominent in your mind. |
| **Clustering Illusions** | Falsely assuming that the inevitable bunching of random results in a large sample indicates a trend. |
| **Bizarreness Effect** | Crazy things are easier to remember than common things, providing a distorted sense of “normal.” |
| **Gambler’s Ruin** | Has many meanings, the most important of which is that playing a negative-probability game persistently enough guarantees going broke. |
| **Dunning-Kruger Effect** | Knowing the limits of your intelligence requires a certain level of intelligence, so some people are too stupid to know how stupid they are. |
| **Luxury Paradox** | The more expensive something is the less likely you are to use it, so the relationship between price and utility is an inverted U. Ferraris sit in garages; Hondas get driven. |
